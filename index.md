I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Material Science and Engineering](https://mse.engr.uconn.edu/) at the University of Conneticut where I am advised by [Yuanyuan Zhu](https://zhu.mse.uconn.edu/). In my research, I work on developing image processing (deep learning and traditional computer vision) algorithms for automated analysis of in-situ transmission electron microscopy videos/images. My work also focuses on understanding the reaction kinetics of metal catalyst nanoparticles, and nuclear irradition effects on reactor structural alloys.
