I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Material Science and Engineering](https://mse.engr.uconn.edu/) at the University of Conneticut where I am advised by [Professor Yuanyuan Zhu](https://zhu.mse.uconn.edu/). In my research, I work on developing image processing (deep learning and traditional computer vision) algorithms for automated analysis of in-situ transmission electron microscopy videos/images and establish TEM benchmark datasets . My work also focuses on understanding the material dynamics of metal catalyst nanoparticles in oxidation and reduction conditions, high temperature oxidation mechanism of refactory metals, and nuclear irradition effects on reactor structural alloys.
